When planning a trip around the world, one of the first logistical issues to arise is what to pack. What can you bring that will sustain you the entire way, but not leave you hauling three giant suitcases up and down hills or through airport security?

I mostly cruised other round-the-world travelers' packing lists online to figure out what I ought to bring along, so I thought I'd post my own for the curious and for anyone else who might be considering a similar trip. So, this is everything I'm leaving with.

All lists describe images clockwise from top left.

As noted, some items ended up being cut last-minute (adios, laundry detergent pods), and others are on thin ice already, like the sleeping bag liner. On the other hand, there are things I'm already expecting to buy, like shorts--I definitely thought that one of my pairs of pants was the zip-off kind that transforms into shorts, but I was also definitely wrong. Then again, I did tramp all over China in 98&deg; heat and long pants, so perhaps I won't. Regardless, I'm sure I'll have fun looking back at this entry at the end of my trip and seeing what was totally worth it and what got ditched.
